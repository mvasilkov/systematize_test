systematize test
===

This is a minimal demonstration / testing project for [systematize.scss][1], using libsass and webpack.

There is barely anything to see here. Go to https://github.com/mvasilkov/systematize for the interesting stuff.

**Usage**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mvasilkov/systematize_test.git
cd systematize_test
yarn
yarn build
open dist/index.html
```

In Windows OS, the last command is `start` instead of `open`.
